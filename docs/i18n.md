# Introduction

Plugin translation dictionaries must be stored in **i18n** directory to be detected by the core.

# Translate back end pages

To translate back end pages you'll need to add translations into **admin-back-office** dictionaries.

Let's pretend we want to add a translation for a back end page of a **library** plugin.

## Add translation to dictionaries

**i18n/admin-back-office-en.json**

```json
{
  "BOOK" : {
    "BUY" : "Buy"
  }
}
```

**i18n/admin-back-office-fr.json**

```json
{
  "BOOK" : {
    "BUY" : "Acheter"
  }
}
```

## Use translation

Then you can use the **translate** filter defined by the core (more information on [OpenVeo core documentation](https://github.com/veo-labs/openveo-core)):

```html
<label ng-bind="LIBRARY.BOOK.BUY | translate"></label>
```

Note that the translation id is prefixed by the name of the plugin.

# Translate front end pages

OpenVeo doesn't provide a particular way of developping the client side of front end pages. There is no JavaScript framework imposed. Thus you should use OpenVeo routes to get a particular dictionary. See [OpenVeo core documentation](https://github.com/veo-labs/openveo-core) for more information.
